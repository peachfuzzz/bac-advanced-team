it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was,Drake
a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb' laces get tighter and parka,Drake
hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in the winter cars come,Drake
out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin' and if you planning family vacations you better know,Drake

mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties drake talking yeah man it's a funny thing,Drake
going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah,Drake
mean take it slow drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so,Drake
we destined to meet since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets,Drake
in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause,Drake
she's sweet then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with,Drake
the beat i love it when voyce sings and the is good there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off,Drake

disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy i don't need your apology or,Eminem
your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked,Eminem

have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is,Eminem
approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all,Eminem
them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice,Eminem

the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged,Eminem
grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you,Eminem
slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you,Eminem
take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you,Eminem
had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but,Eminem
it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm,Eminem
the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't,Eminem
call it quits when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions,Eminem

you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a,Eminem
saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his,Eminem
own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where,Eminem

the move momma's always on the news i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems the harder that i try to,Eminem
do that the more it backfires on me all the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see daddy don't want you to,Eminem
see but you see just as much as he did we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me but things,Eminem
have got so bad between us i don't see us ever bein' together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers but,Eminem
then of course everything always happens for a reason i guess it was never meant to be but it's just something we have no control,Eminem
over and that's what destiny is but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll,Eminem
all just be a dream hook now hush little baby don't you cry everything's gonna be alright stiffen that upper lip up little lady i,Eminem

we feel inside it may seem a little crazy pretty baby but i promise momma's gon' be alright heh it's funny i remember back one,Eminem
year when daddy had no money mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from,Eminem
me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin' 'cause daddy felt like a bumsee daddy,Eminem
had a job but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom and at the time every house that,Eminem
we lived in either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your mom was savin' money for you in,Eminem
a jar tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in,Eminem
and stole it and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall,Eminem
apart mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment and dad moved back,Eminem
to the other side of 8 mile on novara and that's when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre and flew,Eminem
you and momma out to see me but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me then you started seein' daddy on,Eminem
the tv and momma didn't like it and you and lainie were too young to understand it papa was a rolling stone momma developed a,Eminem
habit and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness,Eminem
it first hand 'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud now i'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin' lookin',Eminem

it shot we've got some concepts together based on your conversations with rich lee and i think we're ready to go so the basic concept,Eminem
is sort of like an inceptiontype of vibe the whole video sort of happens inside of your head and rihanna in the beginning is gonna,Eminem
act as your therapist and you answer into her office you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off we're not really,Eminem
sure and next thing you know you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career and there's various,Eminem
stops along the way we're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments i had to go home and get my straightjacket redoing,Eminem
this scene actually brings back no memories for me because i don't remember it dr dre would say i'm glad to see you got your,Eminem
coat back on the way things should be the scene from the my name is video with you in the straightjacket and dre as your,Eminem
therapist in the psychiatrist's office therethe song which recieved an oscar for you yes lose yourself will also be included we're gonna go back and,Eminem
revisit the way i am with you jumping off the building falling through the sky with everything moving past you and then we're also gonna,Eminem
do the classic grammy scene with you and elton john performing stan eminem does an impersonation of elton john performing stan at the 00 grammy,Eminem
performance i can't see it all even if i could it'll all be grey but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's,Eminem
not so bad it's not so bad so all these things are going on in your head you're travelling through the elevator looking at it,Eminem
from a new perspective with you watching yourself and then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator you come,Eminem
out and you see this sort of caged beast and the beast is actually slim shady slim shady's inside of this cage and you walk,Eminem
up and you don't really know what's going on and then you see it's actually yourself and slim shady's feeding you some notes and we,Eminem
can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them and the idea that you keep feeding slim,Eminem
shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it and the songs'll keep coming back out so it's really kind of,Eminem
a trip it's very surreal less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through,Eminem
this journey so anyway call me back after you listen to this um i sent the treatment over read through it and get ready for,Eminem

before i begin i would like to note that i am not a barb thats not to be taken as a negative statement but rather,Nicki Minaj
to let you the reader know that my opinions arent biased with that out of the way i am someone who extremely respects the accelerated,Nicki Minaj
rise of a superstar and not just someone who tops the billboard hot 00 with one or two songs to later fade into nonrelevance dont,Nicki Minaj
get me wrong i'm all about artists having their moment but creating that moment while still a pretty monumental task is the easy part what's,Nicki Minaj
hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top to become a mainstay in the music industry it takes multiple hit songs impressive live performances,Nicki Minaj
educated sitdown interviews and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar it also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers,Nicki Minaj
because lets face it how can someone be labeled a superstar without having earned the respect from fans the media and even other artists and,Nicki Minaj
while its not often that a new superstar emerges if i had one word to describe nicki minaj and her meteoric rise to fame it,Nicki Minaj

family had a rough childhood as her father attended laguardia high school not because of her rapping but acting and was eventually signed to lil,Nicki Minaj
waynes young money label during the lengthy bidding war for nicki minaj which involved various record labels lil wayne had hopes that she would eventually,Nicki Minaj
sign with him and become the first lady of young money after some persuasion as well as a 5 million dollar signingbonus his dream became,Nicki Minaj
a reality that following year as we all know with the release of her debut album pink friday a superstar began to emerge whats so,Nicki Minaj
ironic about the accelerated rise to fame for nicki minaj is that the adversity she had to deal with as a child isnt even the,Nicki Minaj
biggest obstacle that she had to overcome to be a star the real hurdle in her way and one that has caused problems for many,Nicki Minaj
female rappers of this past decade was making a name for herself in the maledriven and maledominated world that is rap with a large amount,Nicki Minaj

charlamagne let's shift gears for a minute and talk about new york city i actually get in arguments because people say nicki doesn't rep new,Nicki Minaj
york i say what do you mean she shouts it out all of the time nicki minaj y'all don't want me to rep y'all y'all,Nicki Minaj
don't hear when i rep y'all cause y'all be dickriding everybody else charlamagne she does have a point do you feel you get the proper,Nicki Minaj
love from new york nicki minaj hell fucking no charlamagne and i never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other,Nicki Minaj
rappers you did the dvds you did the mixtapes you came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in new york nicki minaj i,Nicki Minaj
was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking bmw out on jamaica mutherfucking avenue to amadu and hussaine and these niggas fuck you niggas you,Nicki Minaj
niggas don't know the fucking half of what i've fucking been through _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne well sir isaac newton said the law of energy is energy,Nicki Minaj
is not lost or destroyed it is merely transferred from on party to the next you got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes,Nicki Minaj
something negative about you you read it and now you're miserable nicki minaj absolutely right absolutely charlemange what you think about the blogs scaff beezy,Nicki Minaj
scaff sb beezy honestly the blogs could just suck my damn cock balls deepthroat gag and choke _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne so miss nicki minaj what do,Nicki Minaj
you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like lady gaga or madonna and you're doing things for shock,Nicki Minaj
value nicki minaj well i mean i don't know in a minute if i fucking sit down and piss they're going to tell me i,Nicki Minaj
can't do that cause another bitch did it scaff sb beezy stupid ass bitches yo niggas just want to compare her to somebody nicki minaj,Nicki Minaj
everybody if they ever see me sitting down and peeing they're gonna fucking stone me scaff sb beezy they're gonna say you're trying to be,Nicki Minaj
like barack's wife look at her she's sitting down and peeing like that you trying to be like michelle nicki minaj why you sitting down,Nicki Minaj
and peeing nicki scaff sb beezy why don't you stand up charlemange that happens to everybody though nicki minaj it does scaff sb beezy no,Nicki Minaj
nicki gets it so hard pause hospital flow need more gauze charlamagne i think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something,Nicki Minaj
to make themselves feel comfortable nicki minaj absolutely i always say that for their minds to interpret it they have to draw a comparison and,Nicki Minaj
i always say even though it's very common it's just a more simpleminded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the,Nicki Minaj
first time it is what it is but even she gets compared to madonna and it's a neverending cycle but i rather you compare me,Nicki Minaj
to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to charlamagne someone that is washed that's a natural emotion though it's easy for,Nicki Minaj
a loser to be jealous of a winner that's just the way that it is do you ever look back at some of your performances,Nicki Minaj
and look at your costumes and your wigs and say i did look like a damn fool nicki minaj yes yes i do yes i,Nicki Minaj
do charlemagne do you ever think that scaff sb beezy sometimes every now and then you know what i like about superstars i like my,Nicki Minaj
superstars to be out there jump out the window be like prince with your ass out i may see it and say damn she looks,Nicki Minaj
like a fool but you're a superstar that's how i want to see my superstars i don't want to see my superstars regular _________________________________________________________________ nicki,Nicki Minaj
minaj i keep saying this i went to school for theater i took four years of my life and devoted it to theater i did,Nicki Minaj
that because my passion was acting when i started rapping i felt like i couldn't really be myself when i started winning i started feeling,Nicki Minaj
that i can be myself i can do my accents i can do my voices i can do my faces i can do costumes i,Nicki Minaj
can now bring me to who you know people see as nicki minaj i can now really bring me into it and i think that's,Nicki Minaj
where the confusion lies is that people thought that when i first came out that that was me in my entirety but that wasn't that,Nicki Minaj
was a small facet of who i was but who you see now is just a more multifaceted mixture of all the personalities that i,Nicki Minaj
have in me i mean and i think that if i was to not show that then i wouldn't be doing justice to all the,Nicki Minaj
people that feel like i do cause for every person who doesn't understand it is there is a person who feels like me who feels,Nicki Minaj
like sometimes i just break out in an english accent you know like what's wrong with that charlemagne you can why not _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne do,Nicki Minaj
you think that mixtape nicki and pop nicki can exist in the same space nicki minaj they already are they're already existing together and they,Nicki Minaj
are both winning charlemagne who do you feel that you lean towards more nicki minaj i can't choose i can't pick i feel like the,Nicki Minaj
world makes them two different people but in my mind they're the same person that's what i keep saying i grew up in new york,Nicki Minaj
my whole life i would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend and then monday through friday i,Nicki Minaj
was having a ninetofive on wall street when i was an office manager i wasn't having the same conversation in the office that i was,Nicki Minaj
having on the block but i was still the same person i was onika but i knew how to switch it up and have an,Nicki Minaj
intelligent conversation with one group of people get a job ace the interview and then go home with my home girls and have fun charlemagne,Nicki Minaj
it seems like you're very versatile if it's one thing that i would love for little girls to embrace from nicki minaj is the fact,Nicki Minaj
that she is versatile she knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting nicki,Nicki Minaj
minaj right because you can't do too much of either you really can't it's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to,Nicki Minaj
lean only to one side when that is detrimental for your future it's detrimental for your growth it's detrimental to your longevity at a certain,Nicki Minaj
point as a woman i'm not talking about as a man because we've seen the blueprint with jay we've seen that you could come in,Nicki Minaj
the game and do 0 5 still win and still be the king of hip hop we have not seen that with a woman so,Nicki Minaj
show me the blueprint that's all i want you to do show me the blueprint charlemagne i think you are creating it because queen latifah,Nicki Minaj
doesn't exist in that space anymore she went on to become an actress nicki minaj and is someone who i tip my hat to because,Nicki Minaj
queen latifah looked at it and said okay wait hmm i may not want to be 40 years old rapping the hip hop fans may,Nicki Minaj
not want to hear me when i'm 40 years old rapping so i'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who,Nicki Minaj
i am can be seen queen latifah does musicals movies voiceovers for cartoons is she a sellout or is she winning charlemagne she's winning nicki,Nicki Minaj
minaj so these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed and they're living in you know low income housing is that winning,Nicki Minaj
just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap the same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way,Nicki Minaj
that downloaded the shit get the fuck out of here _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne when it's all said and done are you going to want to have,Nicki Minaj
kids get married nicki minaj oh my goodness i have to i have to yep i'm gonna get married and have kids i love children,Nicki Minaj
i am obsessed with children and yeah i believe in marriage and i believe marriage is forever so that's the other thing scaff sb beezy,Nicki Minaj
look in my eyes look in my eyes know that we'll always be forever moment in time moment in time nicki minaj safaree safaree _________________________________________________________________,Nicki Minaj
charlemagne do you have any regrets cause you've had a relatively short career this is the second album and hopefully we can ten more of,Nicki Minaj
these but do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been nicki minaj nicki minaj i think my only regret would be,Nicki Minaj
not enjoying every single moment when i could have charlemange how can the author of i wish i could enjoy this moment for life not,Nicki Minaj
be here trying to enjoy every moment nicki minaj absolutely and that's the thing it kinda just comes so quickly scaff sb beezy pause nicki,Nicki Minaj
minaj and then all of a sudden it's like wait a minute i just did super bowl i just did super bowl with madonna and,Nicki Minaj
before i go into the super bowl stage i'm just stressing and worrying and then when i come off it's all done and what i,Nicki Minaj
did i even enjoy about it charlemagne not even that you closed up the grammy's scaff sb beezy but that's why cause she's doing the,Nicki Minaj
super bowl and she's thinking about the grammy's nicki minaj and then i'm doing the grammy's and i'm thinking about the nba allstar game that's,Nicki Minaj
the only thing i've gotten to a very good place though all of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to,Nicki Minaj
me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled i used to be and every time i tell people no,Nicki Minaj
no i'm really good i'm really happy i'm really at a peaceful place it's almost like they don't believe me so i thought the other,Nicki Minaj
day i must have really really been worried a lot because people who know me very well are like are you sure you're ok but,Nicki Minaj
i really am i've never been this happy i'm so proud of this album i'm proud of myself and i will not allow anyone to,Nicki Minaj
scare me out of my true potential it's a scare tactic _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne what is nicki minaj's purpose because from the outside looking in i,Nicki Minaj
think you're a very blessed individual because you got two things going against you number one you're a female and the female hip hop division,Nicki Minaj
was not existent before you started popping and then you're from new york there's a lot of rappers from new york that aren't popping right,Nicki Minaj
now so you got those two things going against you being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that,Nicki Minaj
you are it's like she's obviously here for something i think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know but what is nicki minaj's,Nicki Minaj
purpose nicki minaj i have to pray on that i think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my,Nicki Minaj
younger fans really i've always had this dream of having a nicki minaj ymca type of thing when i was young well everybody knows my,Nicki Minaj
story we didn't have a lot free lunch was the thing we can get free lunch oh we're going to free lunch this is like,Nicki Minaj
dope so i remember those moments and i always play them back in my head and i wish to think to myself i wish there,Nicki Minaj
was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that but things were moving so quickly,Nicki Minaj
my parents were so not really stable and just my father being an addict and all that in a lot of ways i feel like,Nicki Minaj
i didn't really have a childhood so when i see kids it melts my heart because i'm looking at them and i'm like they'll never,Nicki Minaj
get this moment back again and they'll always remember this time how do we as adults optimize it for them right now whether they have,Nicki Minaj
money or not i think that one day i would like to do something for them for kids in the inner cities for them to,Nicki Minaj
have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling tutoring i remember i was really really smart in school,Nicki Minaj
and i think my mother took that for granted so she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that,Nicki Minaj
extra push but i think that kids need that it's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education but that's,Nicki Minaj
real shit i don't just say that because it sounds good i really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a,Nicki Minaj
point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college i feel like college,Nicki Minaj
was not something that was engraved in my brain i don't feel like that ever happened most of my closest girlfriends it was just like,Nicki Minaj
once they got out of high school they figured oh well we're good now we're out of high school or i got my ged i'm,Nicki Minaj
good and i don't want my fans to think like that i have such a great rapport with my fans when they see me they,Nicki Minaj
really be bringing out their bachelor's and their master's saying look nicki look because they know how important it is to me it's ok to,Nicki Minaj
have fun i'mma give you the raunchiest sometimes but i also want you to realize that it's for a time one day you're going to,Nicki Minaj
look back and think wait a minute did i really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where i could've been building,Nicki Minaj
myself as a woman and having something to offer my children we got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the,Nicki Minaj
first thing to say to a child but you're having a child because i want to keep this dude or it just happened i want,Nicki Minaj
to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that we're the ones in control again why are,Nicki Minaj
we never in control why are we stuck with a baby why are we always stuck on the welfare line why are we always stuck,Nicki Minaj
having to beg borrow and steal to provide for our children why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby waiting,Nicki Minaj
until you're 5 or 6 to have children technology has changed you can wait have something to offer them that's something that's dear to my,Nicki Minaj
heart doing something that makes children feel like i don't have to rush to grow up i can enjoy my childhood i can have somewhere,Nicki Minaj
to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes that's my bigger goal in life charlemagne how do you stay humble i know,Nicki Minaj
you keep a tight circle you keep guys like scaff beezy around i'm gonna ask scaff how do you keep her humble scaff beezy do,Nicki Minaj
you ever see her getting a little bit extra scaff sb beezy you wanna know what's crazy yesterday remember i was saying to you it's,Nicki Minaj
so crazy she's so famous if she goes out anytime we go somewhere it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie the other day we went,Nicki Minaj
to a carnival we thought we'd be able to be in there and just go on some rides and nobody will notice anything within like,Nicki Minaj
seven minutes the whole park it was 0 5 minutes until we got out she really hasn't changed she really don't act like i'm this,Nicki Minaj
person or i'm that person she just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that,Nicki Minaj
it doesn't faze her she really hasn't changed a bit _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne pay attention to that how did you escape being more than just an,Nicki Minaj
ass nicki minaj we said that the other day before i was just a rapping butt safaree sb samuels a butt with lyrics charlemagne how,Nicki Minaj
did you get out of that nicki minaj because i created a brand people take for granted how hard it is so shout out to,Nicki Minaj
every woman and man that's won it's very hard mentally this shit is draining and draining for you to be able to get up there,Nicki Minaj
and do music that people love and do interviews with a smile on your face and act like this shit ain't getting to you it's,Nicki Minaj
draining it's crazy that's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics when i was coming up i never understood it i use,Nicki Minaj
to be like what they are so ungrateful why are they on drugs why don't they fucking appreciate their success i would kill to be,Nicki Minaj
where they are until you get here and you are like oh my god lord is this the price i have to pay if i,Nicki Minaj
really want this and he's like yep now let's see who really want it but i think i became more than that because people cannot,Nicki Minaj
deny at the end of the day people can't deny that charlamagne you the shit say it you don't have to be humble be like,Nicki Minaj
ray j i'm tired of being humble nicki minaj i'm not a cocky person by nature charlemagne scaff be cocky for her scaff sb beezy,Nicki Minaj
yeah yeah yeah man you bitches ain't shit man you need to just really when you see her get the rose petals just like she's,Nicki Minaj
said before throw it out in front of her feet you pour out the champagne you feed her grapes if something needs to be sucked,Nicki Minaj
you suck it nicki minaj what what would need to be sucked on you scaff sb beezy ay anything anywhere i'm in these streets looking,Nicki Minaj
for work we're all in these streets we're looking for that work that twerk _________________________________________________________________ charlemagne i just want to tell you nicki i think,Nicki Minaj
that you're very necessary i think you represent something way bigger than hip hop i think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels,Nicki Minaj
and i think like how jayz took it to heights and made people be like damn hip hop can take you this far i think,Nicki Minaj
you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further so keep doing your thing ma nicki minaj thank you darling charlemange da god,Nicki Minaj
